### 👋 Hi, there!

### 🍁 Industry Experience

I had founded `edutech startups`, where I worked as `a CEO and full-stack engiener` for 10 years, developing online learing forum, online course platform or so. Currently, I am working at a `mobility startup` as `a backend engineer`, developing services for designated driving, vehicle delivery, and medical accompaniment. I’m looking forward to working at a mobility or e-commerce startup next.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack Experience

I pursue being a generalist as a learner and a specialist as a professional. To make software, I focus on backend engineering, DevOps engineering, and frontend engineering in that order. To make artifical intelligence, I focus on learning data engineering, MLOps engineering, machine learning engineering, and AI engineering in that order.
